## How it works
From the difficulty page each button has number associated with it. so easy is 2.
When the level opens, an object is generated double the number of difficulty. The object is then shuffled and rendred on the screen, So all genrated, thus no 2 replays should be the same only by changce .. 

### To modify levels 
In the Game.tsx modify the value of the difficulty sent with the URL `useNavigation`, or add a new level with desired difficulty.

## NOTE
This is not a complete project, just a past time activity so things might break or not work the way it should.
